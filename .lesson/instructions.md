# Instructions  

---

In this lesson, you will need to modify
the existing components in this project
so that every text in parentheses, such as
(Repo name) or (Username) is 
replaced with props. You will have
to take the `userData` object in 'App.jsx'
and pass the corresponding values down
to the other components using props.

Look out for 'RepoInfo.jsx'
since you will only show the active 
repository and will need to add 
contributors as list items. Finally, in 'LeftBar.jsx',
you must use some kind of loop to show all of the
`RepoBar` components instead of hard-coding them.
